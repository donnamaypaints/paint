Website Structure: Donna May Paints
------------------------------------

**Overview:**
The "Donna May Paints" website is a static portfolio site for artist Donna May Boyes. It showcases her artwork, provides information about her, and includes a blog and contact method. The site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes Jekyll for local development and potentially for deployment.

**Directory and File Structure:**

*   `/` (Root Directory)
    *   `index.html`: Main landing page (Homepage).
    *   `gallery.html`: Displays the artist's collection of paintings, with categorization.
    *   `about.html`: Contains biographical information about the artist and a contact form.
    *   `blog.html`: Blog page, currently with placeholder content.
    *   `css/`: Directory containing stylesheets.
        *   `styles.css`: The primary (and likely only) stylesheet for the entire website. It includes responsive design rules.
    *   `images/`: Directory containing all image assets used across the site (paintings, UI elements, artist photos).
    *   `pricelist.txt`: A plain text file, presumably listing prices for artworks. (Its usage within the site is not explicitly detailed in current HTML but the file exists).
    *   `CNAME`: Contains the custom domain name for the website, typically used with services like GitHub Pages.
    *   `.htaccess`: Configuration file for Apache web servers (may or may not be actively used depending on the hosting environment; often used for redirects, caching rules, etc.).
    *   `_site/`: Default Jekyll output directory. This is where Jekyll generates the final static site to be served. Not manually edited.
    *   `.jekyll-cache/`: Cache directory used by Jekyll to speed up build times. Not manually edited.
    *   `STRUCTURE.txt`: This file, providing an overview of the site structure.

**Key Pages and Functionality:**

*   **Homepage (`index.html`):**
    *   Hero section with a prominent title and call-to-action button.
    *   "Featured Works" section displaying a small selection of paintings.
*   **Gallery Page (`gallery.html`):**
    *   Displays a grid of paintings.
    *   Features interactive category filters (e.g., Landscapes, Florals, Animals).
    *   Shows details (like size, price/availability) for each painting, likely on hover or click.
*   **About/Contact Page (`about.html`):**
    *   Provides biographical information about Donna May Boyes.
    *   Includes a contact form that submits data to Formspree.
*   **Blog Page (`blog.html`):**
    *   Designed to host blog posts.
    *   Currently contains placeholder entries, indicating it is "under construction."
*   **Common Elements:**
    *   **Header:** Consistent across pages, containing the site logo (`Donna May Paints`) and main navigation links (Home, Gallery, About/Contact, Blog).
    *   **Footer:** Consistent across pages, with social media links (Instagram) and copyright information.
*   **Styling and Interactivity:**
    *   Visuals are controlled by `css/styles.css`, featuring a dark theme with specific accent colors.
    *   JavaScript is used for:
        *   Fade-in animations on elements as they scroll into view (using Intersection Observer).
        *   Gallery filtering logic on `gallery.html`.

**Technical Notes:**

*   **Static Site:** The website consists of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
*   **Jekyll:** The project is set up to be served and likely built by Jekyll, a static site generator. This is evident from the `jekyll serve` command, the `_site` directory, and `.jekyll-cache`.
    *   While Jekyll is used, the primary HTML pages (`index.html`, `about.html`, etc.) appear to be largely self-contained rather than heavily relying on Jekyll's advanced templating features like `_layouts` or `_includes` in their current state (based on observation, full Jekyll structure not deeply inspected).
*   **Responsive Design:** The CSS includes media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile).
*   **External Services:**
    *   Google Fonts: Used for custom typography ('Cormorant Garamond', 'Merriweather').
    *   Font Awesome: Used for icons (e.g., Instagram icon).
    *   Formspree: Used to handle submissions from the contact form.

**Overall Assessment:**
The file structure is logical and well-suited for a personal portfolio website. It's relatively simple to navigate and manage. The use of Jekyll provides a good foundation for local development and deployment.
